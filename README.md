### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Linh. I also can be called Shift. I'm currently studying at Ports and Telecommunications Institute of Technology.
My major is Information Technology. I love playing video games, sightseeing, listen to music, or podcast.
My goal is to become a part of Games Industry, so I am learning about it as well as my studies at the school.

I'm prefer using Unity, C#, C++, and GoDot in the future.

Thanks/
